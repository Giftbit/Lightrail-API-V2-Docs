# Welcome to Lightrail

<p class="intro">Lightrail’s API and web app enable you to create modern payment experiences that influence customers.</p>

Businesses use different types of values—such as gift cards, promotions, loyalty points, and referral credits—to influence consumers. These different types of values can together be categorized as _customer value_ and are part of the payment experience. Lightrail’s API and web app enables you to create, process, and manage customer value across your business.
 
Lightrail’s API provides two primary capabilities that allow you to use customer value as a secure, flexible, and effective tool for your business and growth team. Those two capabilities are:

<ol>
<li>a digital wallet for each of your customers, and</li> 
<li>a checkout integration that simplifies multi-tender payments with rule-based customer value.</li>
</ol> 

#### Who Is Lightrail For? 

Lightrail is an API-first platform that you integrate into your tech stack to create a custom payment experience. Lightrail is used by development-oriented startups and modern enterprise businesses. Lightrail is flexible. It supports single brand e-commerce requirements, subscriptions businesses, and the more sophisticated requirements of marketplaces and multi-merchant coalitions.

#### Checkout
The Checkout API endpoint allows you to submit a customer's shopping cart for payment processing. Lightrail calculates the subtotal from the line items in the shopping cart, applies any Lightrail discounts or pre-paid sources, and finally charges the credit card all in a single request. Lightrail handles the complexity of charging these sources in the correct order, creating a seamless payment experience for your customer.
