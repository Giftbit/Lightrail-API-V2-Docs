# Welcome to Lightrail

<p class="intro">Lightrail is an API and webapp that allows you to create modern payment experiences.</p>

Modern payment experiences involve using different types of values to influence consumers—such as gift cards, promotions, loyalty points, and referral credits. These emerging types of values can be categorized as customer value. Your business can create, process, and manage all types of customer value using Lightrail. 

Lightrail’s API enables two primary capabilities that enable customer value as a secure, flexible, and effective tool for your business and growth team. Those two capabilities are:

<ol>
<li>a digital wallet for each of your customers, and</li> 
<li>a checkout integration that simplifies multi-tender payments with rule-based customer value.</li>
</ol> 

#### Who Is Lightrail For? 

Lightrail is an API-first tool that allows you to build-in and customize your payment experience. Lightrail is flexible and supports single brand e-commerce requirements and also supports more sophisticated marketplace requirements. 

#### Incentivize Your Customers

Lightrail enables you to build Customer Wallet solutions where all of the the promotions, gift cards, and loyalty points are associated with that customer’s identity. Lightrail believes that With this you can create frictionless payment experiences. 

#### Checkout
The Checkout API Endpoint allows you to submit a customer's shopping cart for payment processing. Lightrail will calculate the subtotal from the line items in the shopping cart, apply any Lightrail discounts or pre-paid sources, and finally charge the credit card all in a single request. Lightrail handles the complexity of charging these sources in the correct order creating a seamless payment experience for your customer.
