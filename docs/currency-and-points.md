# Currency and Points

Lightrail supports any standard 3-character [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) including custom currencies you create.    

Example custom currency:
``` 
{
  "code": "STARS",
  "name": "Star points",
  "symbol": "‚≠ê",
  "decimalPlaces": 0
}
```

Note, Lightrail does not automatically support any currency conversion.
