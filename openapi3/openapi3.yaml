    ## Authentication

    Authentication is done via an authorization header. You can retrieve your Lightrail API key [here](https://www.lightrail.com).

    In requests to Lightrail you must include the following header:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
    ```

    ## Dates & Durations
    All dates and durations are sent and received in ISO 8601 format.

    Date format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ`
    Example date: `2007-04-05T14:30:00.000Z`

    Duration format: `PnYnMnDTnHnMnS`
    Example duration: `P7DT12H`

    ## Filtering

    Resources that may contain lots of entries ([Contacts](#operation/ListContacts), [Values](#operation/ListValues), [Programs](#tag/Programs/list-programs), [Transactions](#operation/ListTransactions)) have filters for retrieving a subset of the entries.

    Some query filter properties support operators for more powerful filtering.  The operator is specified after the property and a dot (eg: `balance.ne` for balance not equal to).

    | operator | description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | lt       | Less than (&lt;). |
    | lte      | Less than or equal to (&lt;=). |
    | gt       | Greater than (&gt;). |
    | gte      | Greater than or equal to (&gt;=). |
    | eq       | Equal to (==).  This is the default where no operator is specified. |
    | ne       | Not equal to (!=). |
    | in       | Equals one of the members of a comma-separated list.  Literal commas must be escaped (\\,). |
    | like     | Equal to with wildcard support.  Percent signs (%) in the value are wild.  This operator is only supported on string properties. |
    | isNull   | Equal to null (true) or not equal to null (false). |
    | orNull   | Allows other filters acting on the same property to also include results if the property is equal to null (true), or, not equal to null (false). |

    **Examples**

    1. List [Contacts](#operation/ListContacts) where `email` equals "mia.wallace@example.com" or "mia_wallace@example.com":
    `https://api.lightrail.com/v2/contacts?email.in=mia.wallace@example.com,mia_wallace@example.com`

    2. List [Values](#operation/ListValues) where `currency` equals "USD" and `balance` greater than or equal to $10:
    `https://api.lightrail.com/v2/values?currency=USD&balance.gte=1000`

    3. List [Contacts](#operation/ListContacts) where `email` address is "like" `%@gmail.com` where `%` acts as a wild card (ie: ends with @gmail.com).
    `https://api.lightrail.com/v2/contacts?email.like=%@gmail.com`

    4. List [Programs](#tag/Programs/list-programs) where `endDate` is greater than date or `null` (ie: filtering for non-expired).
    `https://api.lightrail.com/v2/programs?endDate.gt=2019-11-08T12:00:00.000Z&endDate.orNull=true`

    ## Paging

    Resources that may contain lots of entries ([Contacts](#operation/ListContacts), [Values](#operation/ListValues), [Programs](#tag/Programs/list-programs)) may not return all results in a single response.  Instead they return a number of results limited by the `limit` query parameter.

    Retrieving results after the first page means following links in the [Link header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988).  Here's an example Link header...

    ```text
    (all line-breaks are inserted here for clarity and don't exist in production)

    Link:
      </v2/contacts?limit=100>;
        rel="first",
      </v2/contacts?limit=100&before=eyJpZCI6ImplZmYgaXMgYXdlc29tZSJ9>;
        rel="prev",
      </v2/contacts?limit=100&next=eyJpZCI6ImplbiBpcyBhd2Vzb21lIHRvbyJ9>;
        rel="next",
      </v2/contacts?limit=100&last=true>;
        rel="last"
    ```

    This example has links to the first page, the previous page, the next page, and the last page.  When already at the first page there will only be links to the next and last.  When already at the last page there will only be links to the first and prev.  If there are no results to page though or only one page there will not be any links.

    It's important to follow the links in the Link header and not construct the URLs on your own.

    ## Errors

    Lightrail uses the following HTTP status codes to indicate an error:

    | code | meaning |
    |------|---------|
    | 400  | The request could not be understood.  eg: JSON body could not be parsed. |
    | 401  | Authentication missing. |
    | 403  | The operation is not allowed for the given authentication. |
    | 404  | The resource was not found.  eg: There is no Contact for the given ID. |
    | 409  | The operation could not be performed because of the state of the system.  eg: There is not enough balance for a Transaction to complete. |
    | 422  | The request was understood but has a logical problem.  eg: Attempting to credit a negative amount. If using the `stripe` payment rail, most Stripe errors will result in a `422`. |
    | 424  | The request failed due to a failed third party dependency (such as an error calling Stripe). This can indicate that Lightrail and a third party are an inconsistent state. eg: While attempting to reverse a checkout Transaction with two Stripe charges, the first charge is refunded but the second refund fails. Refunds in Stripe cannot be undone which leaves the system in a state that it cannot automatically recover from. Note, this status code is extremely rare and represents a worst-case scenario for which some intervening action will be necessary. |
    | 429  | Too many requests in a given amount of time. |
    | 500  | Internal server error.  Please [contact us](mailto:hello@lightrail.com) with details of your request and we'll look into it. |

    Lightrail errors contain a JSON body with the following properties:

    | property    | always present | purpose |
    |-------------|----------------|---------|
    | message     | yes            | English explanation of the error.  This is for display purposes only as the explanation may be formatted or change between system updates. |
    | statusCode  | yes            | The HTTP status code. |
    | messageCode | no             | A constant corresponding to the message.  This can be used to take action in response to the error. |
    | stripeError | no             | When using the `stripe` rail: the full error response from Stripe in case of an error charging a credit card. |

    An example:

    ```json
    {
        "message": "Insufficient balance for the transaction.",
        "statusCode": 409,
        "messageCode": "InsufficientBalance"
    }
    ```

      summary: Attach a Contact to a Value
      description: |-
        Attaching a Value to a Contact will associate the Value with the Contact. The Contact then "has" that Value. In a checkout Transaction, specifying the `contactId` as a payment source will resolve to all associated Values for the Contact to be considered for the Transaction.

        If attaching a Unique Value (`isGenericCode=false`) the Value's `contactId` will be set to the ID of the Contact attached to it. If attaching a Generic Code (`isGenericCode=true`) it depends on whether the Generic Code has `genericCodeOptions.perContact` properties set. If set, attaching will result in a new Value being created using the perContact properties for the new Value's `balance` and `usesRemaining`. If not set, the Generic Code will be shared and the Contact will receive a reference to the Generic Code. You can [list the Value's Contacts](#tag/Values/list-a-value's-attached-contacts) to see all Contacts attached to the Value.

      description: |-
        The checkout endpoint collects all payment for a purchase.  It can apply all Lightrail promotions, calculate tax, debit funds from Lightrail and charge credit cards through Stripe. Your Stripe account must be [connected to Lightrail](https://www.lightrail.com/app/#/account/api) in order for Lightrail to make charges on your behalf.

        Lightrail and Stripe payment sources are referred to as the payment rails `lightrail` and `stripe` respectively. There is also an `internal` payment rail which can be used to represent any other payment source. This is intended as a stop-gap solution to support transitioning from legacy systems.

        Error responses: If using the `stripe` rail, it is possible for checkout transactions to fail for reasons outside of Lightrail's control, such as an invalid card token or a card being declined. Stripe errors will be passed on in full under the `stripeError` key in the response.

tags:
  - name: Contacts
    description: |-
      Contacts are the people or businesses who buy products or services from you.  They're identified by a unique `id`, which typically corresponds to an existing identifier in your system.

      Values can be [attached](#operation/AttachContactToValue) to Contacts.  All (applicable) Value attached to a Contact will be used in a [checkout Transaction](#operation/Checkout) simply by specifying the Contact checking out.
  - name: Currencies
    description: |-
      A Currency is a unit of money in Lightrail.  It can be a standard currency such as `USD`, or a made up currency such as `FUNBUX`.  All currencies must be created before they are used, though they are typically created on initial setup in the web app.
  - name: Programs
    description: |-
      Programs organize [Values](#tag/Values) and Values can be [issued](#operation/CreateIssuance) from Programs.  Programs are typically created through the web app.

      Programs are most commonly used to define and organize promotion campaigns. For example, the Value issued for a new user promotion that gives them a 5% discount on their first purchase should behave differently from the Value for a "TEN-DOLLAR-TUESDAYS" promotion. These different promotions will also need to be tracked and analyzed separately, all of which can happen in the web app.
  - name: Transactions
    description: |-
      Transactions can add and remove balance on Lightrail Values or create Stripe charges.

      Lightrail Values cannot be transacted against if they are inactive, canceled, frozen, have not yet started or have ended.
  - name: Values
    description: |-
      A Value (naturally) represents value in the Lightrail system.  This includes a gift card, a promotion, a coupon, store credit, etc.  Values can be created one at a time or [issued](#operation/CreateIssuance) from a [Program](#tag/Programs).  Issuing Value from a Program makes it part of that Program which keeps different ways of using Value organized.

      Most Values will be accessed by a code, or attached to a [Contact](#tag/Contacts).  All Values attached to a Contact can be used in a [checkout Transaction](#operation/Checkout) by only specifying the Contact.
  - name: Webhooks
    description: |-
      Webhooks can notify your application when Lightrail events occur. They enable you to react to events and trigger additional workflows.
