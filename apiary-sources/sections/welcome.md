# Lightrail Documentation

Welcome to Lightrail V2. Lightrail makes it easy to create gift cards, manage customer account credit, run promotional discount programs, and collect payment all in one unified checkout solution. 

The Lightrail system revolves around two core concepts:

**Programs** allow you to specify how value is made available to your customers, whether that means running a "25% off everything this weekend" site-promotion, selectively giving your top customers extra loyalty points, or selling gift cards. 

**Value Stores** are created based on a particular Program and represent the actual value available to your customers, from unique coupon codes to reloadable accounts. 

You can attach value directly to **Customers** in the Lightrail system. Customers records in Lightrail are linked to records in your existing system through a shared identifier, so you can easily track spending behaviour. 

See our examples below to get started with gift cards, account credit, or promotions.
