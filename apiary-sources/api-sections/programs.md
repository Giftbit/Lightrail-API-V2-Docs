## Programs [/programs]

Programs organize [Values](#reference/0/values) and Values can be [issued](#reference/0/programs/create-issuance) from Programs.  Programs are typically created through the web app.

Programs are most commonly used to define and organize promotion campaigns. For example, the Value issued for a new user promotion that gives them a 5% discount on their first purchase should behave differently from the Value for a "TEN-DOLLAR-TUESDAYS" promotion. These different promotions will also need to be tracked and analyzed separately, all of which can happen in the web app.
