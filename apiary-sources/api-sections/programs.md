## Programs [/programs]

Programs define the behaviour of Value that you wish to issue. Programs are typically created through the web app, but an explanation is included here for context and insight into how `Values` function.

Programs are most commonly used to define and organize Promotion campaigns. For example, the `Value` issued for a new user promotion that gives them a 5% discount on their first purchase should behave differently from the `Value` for a "TEN-DOLLAR-TUESDAYS" promotion. These different promotions will also need to be tracked and analyzed separately, all of which can happen in the web app.

Programs can also be used to control and organize gift card campaigns. Lightrail supplies you with a default gift card Program, but you can also choose to create more gift card Programs for custom use cases -- for example, so that B2B gift cards can be handled differently from gift cards that your customers purchase directly from your site.
