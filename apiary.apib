## ValueStores [/valueStores/]

### Value Store Types

From investigating transactions with multiple payment sources (gift cards, accounts, promotions, etc) that operate on shopping carts the following properties were identified in order for payment resolution.

```
ValueStore:
- type of value: 
    - dollar or points value (points is just a different currency). 
    - percent off

```   

```
ValueStore:
- "type of value" - $ value, % off
- appliesTo: "item" | "cart"
- preTax: boolean;
- type: "GIFT_CARD", "ACCOUNT", "PROMOTION" // doesn't really matter
```

Sort of a strange relationship between `appliesTo: "item"` and the redemption rule. How do we know the rule actually relates to an item. 
What if the rule is if the transaction is over $50? Parsing rules to understand them seems somewhat infeasible.

## LineItemResponse (LineItem)
+ someNewField (string) - Blah blah blah
## Transaction (object)
+ transactionId (string, required) - Unique idempotent ID for the Transaction.
+ transactionType (string, required) - The type of the transaction, eg: `debit`, `credit`, `order`...

+ createdDate (string, required) - ISO date for when the transaction was created.
+ metadata (object, optional) - Arbitrary data associated with the Transaction.
## TransactionParty (object)

+ rail (string, required) - Indicates the payment rail. Must be either `lightrail`, `stripe` or `internal`.

## LightrailValueStoreIdTransactionParty (TransactionParty)
+ rail (string, required) - `lightrail`

## LightrailCodeTransactionParty (TransactionParty)
+ rail (string, required) - `lightrail`
