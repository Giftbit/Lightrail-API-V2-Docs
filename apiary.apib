# Group Promotions

## Promotions [/values/promotions]

A Promotion is Value that is given away to incentivise a purchase.  It may be accessed via a code, attached to a Contact or even applied to orders automatically.  It can be balance-based such as $5 or valueRule-based such a 50% off.  A Promotion will typically have a redemption rule that defines when the Promotion applies.

## Values [/values]

A Value (naturally) represents value in the Lightrail system.  It can be a Giftcard, a Promotion or an Account.  The type of Value is distinguished by the `type` member.

## Programs [/programs]

Programs define the behaviour of Value that you wish to issue. Programs are typically created through the web app, but an explanation is included here for context and insight into how `Values` function.

Programs are most commonly used to define and organize Promotion campaigns. For example, the `Value` issued for a new user promotion that gives them a 5% discount on their first purchase should behave differently from the `Value` for a "TEN-DOLLAR-TUESDAYS" promotion. These different promotions will also need to be tracked and analyzed separately, all of which can happen in the web app.

Programs can also be used to control and organize gift card campaigns. Lightrail supplies you with a default gift card Program, but you can also choose to create more gift card Programs for custom use cases -- for example, so that B2B gift cards can be handled differently from gift cards that your customers purchase directly from your site.

## Currencies [/currencies]

A Currency is a unit of money in Lightrail.  It can be a standard currency such as `USD`, or a made up currency such as `FUNBUX`.  All currencies must be created before they are used, though they are typically created on initial setup in the web app.
